#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) runtime = n^^3 / n^^2 = O(n)
a grows by n^^2 and the loops ends at a < n^^3

b) runtime = n / 2 = O(n)
only j depends of n and j grows by times 2

c) runtime = bunnies - 1 = O(n)
bunnies decreases by 1 for each iteration

## Exercise II
